I  am  a  beginner  front-end  developer  who  completed  the
CodersCamp  -  web  programming  course,  organized  by  the
CodersCrew Association.
During  the  course,  apart  from  theoretical  knowledge,  I  also
gained  experience  in  group  projects.  I  am  constantly
developing  and  practicing  my  programming  skills  in
JavaScript.  I  also  want  to  learn  new  technologies  and
solutions. I know well HTML and CSS.
I have a great enthusiasm  for work, passion and  the ability  to
learn quickly.
